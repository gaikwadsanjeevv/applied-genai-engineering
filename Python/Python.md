Short Notes  
- Simple and easy  
- Interpreted language  
- Scripting Language  
- General-purpose programming language :  Desktop app, web apps, Games, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Computing, and more.  
- Python is Data Centric language, which means that it is designed to work with data and has built-in support for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib that make it easy to work with data in Python. Additionally, Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it a popular choice for data scientists and analysts who need to quickly analyze and visualize data.  
- As python is scrting language, it is used to write small programs called scripts.  
- It is used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.    
- It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks.  
- It is known for its readability and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.  
- Python is Dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type of the variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This allows for more flexibility in coding, but it can also lead to errors if you're not careful with your variable assignments.  
- Compiled and Interpreted language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. However, it can also be compiled to bytecode, which can be executed more efficiently. This allows for faster execution of Python code while still maintaining the flexibility of an interpreted language.  
Plaform Independent and portable: Python is a platform-independent language, which means that it can run on any operating system without requiring any modifications to the code. This makes it a popular choice for developers who want to create applications that can run on multiple platforms. Additionally, Python is portable, which means that you can easily move your code from one machine to another without worrying about compatibility issues.
