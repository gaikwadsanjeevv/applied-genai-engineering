- It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks.  
- It is known for its readability and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.  
- Python is Dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type of the variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This allows for more flexibility in coding, but it can also lead to errors if you're not careful with your variable assignments.  
- Compiled and Interpreted language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. However, it can also be compiled to bytecode, which can be executed more efficiently. This allows for faster execution of Python code while still maintaining the flexibility of an interpreted language.  
Plaform Independent and portable: Python is a platform-independent language, which means that it can run on any operating system without requiring any modifications to the code. This makes it a popular choice for developers who want to create applications that can run on multiple platforms. Additionally, Python is portable, which means that you can easily move your code from one machine to another without worrying about compatibility issues.  

#### Programming Language Types:     
- Low level languages: These are programming languages that are closer to machine code and provide little abstraction from the underlying hardware. Examples include Assembly language and Machine language. Ex: C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.  
- High level languages: These are programming languages that provide a higher level of abstraction from the underlying. Examples include Python, Java, Ruby, etc. 
 - Compiler : C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.    
 - Interpreter : Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.  
 - Hybrid : Java, C#, etc.   
- Procedural programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing procedures or routines that operate on data. It emphasizes the use of functions and procedures to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Examples of procedural programming languages include C, Fortran, and Pascal.  
- Object-oriented programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent data and behavior. It emphasizes the use of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and modular code. Examples of object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, and Python.  
- Functional programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of functions to create programs. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, which have no side effects and always return the same output for the same input, to create programs that are easier to reason about and test. Examples of functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.  
- Scripting programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing small programs called scripts that automate tasks or perform specific functions. Scripting languages are often interpreted and provide a high level of abstraction, making them easy to use for tasks such as system administration, web development, and data analysis. Examples of scripting languages include Python, Perl, and Ruby.  

#### Compiler vs Interpreter  
- Compiler: A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code or bytecode before execution. It is generally faster in execution but slower in development and debugging. Examples include C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.  
- Interpreter: An interpreter executes the source code line by line without compiling it first. It is slower in execution but faster in development and debugging. Examples include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.

#### Python is Hybrid Language.  
- Compiler + Interpreter  
- First.py --> Intermediate Code (python Byte code) first.pyc --> Machine Code (Python Virtual Machine) Runtime Environment.  
- Python code is first compiled to bytecode, which is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The bytecode is stored in .pyc files, which are generated automatically when a Python script is executed. The PVM then executes the bytecode, which allows for faster execution of Python code while still maintaining the flexibility of an interpreted language. This hybrid approach allows Python to be both easy to use and efficient, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.  
Does python Does compile and interpret for all python code?  
- Yes, all Python code is first compiled to bytecode and then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine.  
Why need for both compiler and interpreter?  
- The compiler allows for faster execution of Python code by translating it into a low-level representation that can be executed more efficiently. The interpreter allows for greater flexibility and ease of development by allowing developers to write and test code without needing to compile it first. This hybrid approach allows Python to be both easy to use and efficient, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.  

#### Python is Platform Independent and Portable  
- Platform Independent: Python can run on any operating system without requiring any modifications to the code. This is because Python code is compiled to bytecode, which can be executed on any platform that has a compatible Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This makes it a popular choice for developers who want to create applications that can run on multiple platforms.  
- Portable: Python code can be easily moved from one machine to another without worrying about compatibility issues. This is because Python code is written in a high-level language that abstracts away many of the details of the underlying hardware and operating system. Additionally, Python has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks that are designed to be cross-platform, which further enhances its portability. This makes Python a popular choice for developers who want to create applications that can be easily shared and deployed across different environments.  

#### Programming Paradigms.  
- Procedural programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on writing procedures or routines that operate on data. It emphasizes the use of functions and procedures to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Examples of procedural programming languages include C, Fortran, and Pascal.  
- Object-oriented programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent data and behavior. It emphasizes the use of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and modular code. Examples of object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++, and Python.  
- Functional programming:(Support Mathematics functions) This is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of functions to create programs. It emphasizes the use of pure functions, which have no side effects and always return the same output for the same input, to create programs that are easier to reason about and test. Examples of functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala. Due to it vast library python sy=upports many apps in statistics, machine learning, data science, etc.
